# Get started with Azure accounts

To get started with Azure services, you need an Azure subscription. When youâ€™re working on Learn modules, a temporary subscription is often provided for you in the Learn sandbox environment. For your own applications and business needs, you'll need to create an Azure account, which will automatically create a subscription for you. After creating an account, you can set up additional subscriptions. For example, your company might use a single Azure account with separate subscriptions for different departments like development, marketing, and sales. Once you have an Azure subscription, you can begin creating Azure resources within each one.
