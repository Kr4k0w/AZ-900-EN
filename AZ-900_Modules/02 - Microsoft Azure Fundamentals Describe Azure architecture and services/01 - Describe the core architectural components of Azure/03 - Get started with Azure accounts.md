# Get started with Azure accounts

To get started with Azure services, you need an Azure subscription. When youâ€™re working on Learn modules, a temporary subscription is often provided for you in the Learn sandbox environment. For your own applications and business needs, you'll need to create an Azure account, which will automatically create a subscription for you. After creating an account, you can set up additional subscriptions. For example, your company might use a single Azure account with separate subscriptions for different departments like development, marketing, and sales. Once you have an Azure subscription, you can begin creating Azure resources within each one.

Once you're familiar and ready to do more, you can upgrade your free account. Additionally, you can create new subscriptions to pay for any Azure services you need beyond the free account's limits. This way, you have the flexibility to scale and customize your usage as your business grows.

## Create an Azure account
To create an Azure account, you have several options:

1. **Direct Purchase from Microsoft**: Sign up on the Azure website or contact a Microsoft representative.
    
2. **Through a Microsoft Partner**: Purchase Azure access via a Microsoft partner. Cloud Solution Provider partners offer a variety of managed-cloud solutions for Azure.
    

Once you have your Azure account, you'll have the flexibility to access and manage a wide range of cloud services tailored to your business needs.
