Cloud computing is delivering computing services through the internet.

Computing services include:

- **Common IT infrastructure such as:**
	- Virtual Machines
	- Storage
	- Databases
	- Networking
- **Expanding to:**
	- IoT (Internet of things)
	- ML(Machine Learning)
	- AI (Artificial Intelligence)


Because cloud computing uses the internet to deliver these services, it doesn’t have to be constrained by physical infrastructure the same way that a traditional datacenter is. That means if you need to increase your IT infrastructure rapidly, you don’t have to wait to build a new datacenter—you can use the cloud to rapidly expand your IT footprint.
