When building or deploy a cloud application, two of the biggest considerations are uptime(avaliability) and the ability to handle demand(scale)

- **Big Considerations in Cloud Applications**: Uptime and the ability to handle demand.
    
- **High Availability**: Ensuring that IT resources are available when needed, focusing on maximum availability despite disruptions.
    
- **Architecting Solutions**: Account for service availability guarantees. Azure offers uptime guarantees in its SLAs.
