- **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)**: The most flexible cloud service category, providing maximum control over cloud resources.
    
    - **Responsibilities of Cloud Provider**: Maintain hardware, network connectivity, and physical security.
        
    - **Responsibilities of the User**: Operating system installation, configuration, maintenance, network configuration, database, and storage configuration.
        
- **Shared Responsibility Model**:
    
    - **Cloud Provider**: Responsible for maintaining physical infrastructure and its internet access.
        
    - **User**: Responsible for installation, configuration, patching, updates, and security.

**Common Scenarios for IaaS**:

- **Lift-and-Shift Migration**: Setting up cloud resources similar to your on-premises datacenter and moving existing workloads to the IaaS infrastructure.
    
- **Testing and Development**: Quickly replicating established configurations for development and test environments, with the ability to start up or shut down environments rapidly while maintaining control.
