## Describe Software as a Service

**What is Software as a Service (SaaS)?**

Software as a Service (SaaS) is a cloud computing model where you access and use applications via the internet without the need to install or maintain them on your local devices. Instead of owning and managing the software, you're renting the use of it, usually on a subscription basis.

**Example of SaaS:**  
Services like Gmail for email, Google Docs for document editing, or Netflix for streaming movies are all examples of SaaS. The applications run on the cloud, meaning they are hosted on remote servers, and you just interact with them through your browser or app.

**Responsibility in SaaS:**  
In the SaaS model, the cloud provider is responsible for most of the technical management, including infrastructure, security, maintenance, and updates. You, as the user, are responsible for managing your data within the application, controlling access permissions, and ensuring security through user authentication, such as passwords.
