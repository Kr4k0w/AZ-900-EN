## Describe the benefits of high availability and scalability in the cloud

When building or deploy a cloud application, two of the biggest considerations are uptime(avaliability) and the ability to handle demand(scale)

- **Big Considerations in Cloud Applications**: Uptime and the ability to handle demand.
    
- **High Availability**: Ensuring that IT resources are available when needed, focusing on maximum availability despite disruptions.
    
- **Architecting Solutions**: Account for service availability guarantees. Azure offers uptime guarantees in its SLAs.
    
- **Azure SLAs**: These SLAs describe the service availability guarantees.

- **Scalability in Cloud Computing**: Ability to adjust resources to meet demand.
    
- **Benefits of Scalability**: Handle peak traffic by adding resources, and reduce costs by scaling down when demand drops off.
    
- **Types of Scaling**:
    
    - **Vertical Scaling**: Increasing or decreasing the capabilities of resources (e.g., adding/removing CPUs or RAM).
        
    - **Horizontal Scaling**: Adding or subtracting the number of resources (e.g., adding/removing virtual machines or containers).
