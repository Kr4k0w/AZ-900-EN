## Describe the consumption-based model

**CapEx vs. OpEx**

- **CapEx**: One-time, up-front costs for purchasing tangible resources (e.g., buildings, vehicles).
- **OpEx**: Ongoing expenses for services or products over time (e.g., leasing, cloud services).

**Consumption-Based Model**
- Cloud computing operates on an **OpEx** basis.
- **Pay-as-you-go**: Only pay for the IT resources you use.
- Benefits:
    - **No upfront costs**.
    - **Scalability**: Pay for more resources when needed, stop paying when not needed.
    - Avoids over/under-provisioning issues of traditional datacenters.
        

**Cloud Pricing Models**
- **Pay-as-you-go**: Rent compute power and storage, billed only for usage.
- **Efficiency**: Helps plan and manage operating costs, run infrastructure efficiently, and scale as needed.

The consumption-based model in cloud computing allows businesses to efficiently manage costs by paying only for the resources they use, enabling flexibility and scalability without the burden of maintaining physical infrastructure.
