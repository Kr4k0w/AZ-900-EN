## Define cloud models
Cloud models defines the type of cloud resources, and we have three main:
- Private
- Public
- Hybrid

#### Private cloud
- Used by a single entity
- Greater control for the company and IT department
- Higher cost and fewe benefits compared to public cloud
- Can be hosted on-site or off-site, even by third parties

#### Public Cloud
- Built, controlled, and maintained by a third-party provider
- Accessible to anyone who wants to purchase cloud services
- Key difference: general public avaliability

#### Hybrid Cloud
- Uses both, public and private, interconnected
- Allows private cloud to use teh resources of public for increased, temporary demand
- Provides an extra layer of security, with flexibility in choosing which services to keep public or private.

|**Public cloud**|**Private cloud**|**Hybrid cloud**|
|---|---|---|
|No capital expenditures to scale up|Organizations have complete control over resources and security|Provides the most flexibility|
|Applications can be quickly provisioned and deprovisioned|Data is not collocated with other organizations’ data|Organizations determine where to run their applications|
|Organizations pay only for what they use|Hardware must be purchased for startup and maintenance|Organizations control security, compliance, or legal requirements|
|Organizations don’t have complete control over resources and security|Organizations are responsible for hardware maintenance and updates|


**Multi-Cloud:**
- Involves multiple public cloud providers.
- Utilizes different features from different providers.
- Manages resources and security across two or more public cloud environments.
